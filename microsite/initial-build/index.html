            <h1>PLOT</h1>
            <p>In the year 2010, Kanye West takes out his garbage before tripping and falling into a portal, which brings him to the year 3030. The United States has become a dystopian society ruled by a clone of rapper Lil B claiming himself to be a god. A prophecy exists, claiming that Kanye West would return one day and overthrow Lil B. With this knowledge, Kanye West travels this dystopian society and teams up with other musicians such as Jay-Z, 2Pac and RZA to fight to free America. Along the way they are challenged by other musicians such as Eminem, Nicki Minaj, De La Soul and LL Cool J. Upon completing the game Kanye West declares himself the one true "based" God and returns to 2010 where he puts away the trash.
