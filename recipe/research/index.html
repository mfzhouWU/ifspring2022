            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Cake</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>3 eggs</li> 
               <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons Lemon Juice about 1 medium or ½ large</li>
               <li>Zest of one lemon</li>
               <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
               <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
               <li>Powdered sugar to aid in rolling</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup cold heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup lemon curd or pie filling would work too</li>
                <li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a jelly roll (10x15”) pan with foil and spray with cooking spray. (Use the spray with flour or actually grease and flour the foil to avoid sticking.)</li>
                <li>Beat eggs at high speed for 2 minutes, until frothy and dark yellow. Beat in sugar, lemon juice, and zest.</li>
                <li>Whisk together salt, baking powder, and flour. Stir into wet ingredients just until blended.</li>
                <li>Spread in prepared pan. Batter will be in a very thin layer and you will need to use a wooden spoon or spatula to spread it to all the corners of the pan. Bake for 9-11 minutes (mine took 10).</li>
                <li>While the cake is baking, set a clean kitchen towel out on a large work surface. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar (about ¼ cup). As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, turn it over on the kitchen towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Remove foil carefully.</li>
                <li>Working at the short end, fold the edge of the towel over the cake. Roll tightly, rolling up the cake into the towel. Let cool completely while rolled, at least one hour.</li>
                <li>While the cake is chilling, make the filling. Beat the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in the lemon curd. Chill until ready to use.</li>
                <li>When cake is cool, carefully unroll the towel. Spread the lemon whipped cream over the cake. (You might have some whipped cream left over.) Gently but tightly, re-roll the cake and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill until it firms up a bit, at least one hour or overnight. Slice and serve. Cake will last covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Recipe Reference</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appetit</a>: I like how clean and simple the website is, and that it goes straight to the point. I don't like it when there are paragraphs of text before the recipe instructions. The one thing I don't like is that it doesn't have multiple photos.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">AllRecipes</a>: This website is very user friendly as it lets you add ingredients to a shopping list and check off steps that you have completed. I also like how ingredient amount will change depending on how many servings the user will make. It is very convenient.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a>: I like how this website uses columns more than the others as the ingredients and instructions are normally stacked on each other. I also like the big numbers, it creates a sense of hierarchy. The only thing is that the pages feel somewhat cramped.</p>

            <h2>Non-recipe Reference</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/">ETQ</a>: I like how they use and organize large photos. Although the photos are simple they grab your attention.</p>     

            <p><a href="https://3sidedcube.com/en-us/">3SidedCube</a>: Their colors are very bold and are used to draw attention. The choice for different font families creates a sense of hierarchy. I also like the little animations they have.</p>
        
            <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>: I like the way things are organized. This website has clear hierarchy and structure for each subject.</p>
